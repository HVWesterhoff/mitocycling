In this folder one finds supplementary information concerning computer modelling for the 2024 paper Goglia et al. FEBS Journal, entitled 
"Fusion-fission-mitophagy cycling and metabolic reprogramming coordinate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)-dependent neuronal differentiation"
with authors
Ilaria Goglia, Ewelina WÄ™glarz-Tomczak, Claudio Gioia, Yanhua Liu, Assunta Virtuoso, Marcella Bonanomi, Daniela Gaglio, Noemi Salmistraro, Ciro De Luca, Michele Papa, Lilia Alberghina, Hans V Westerhoff and Anna Maria Colangelo
In the folder there is a text file ("Supporting information computational modelling* [as well as an older version called Wff2Supporting ...; which one can disregard and only serves archival purposes]) describing the modelling as well as the actual modelling files.  The latter can be run in Copasi.  Importantly, for each Figure in the paper, there is a model plus instructions how to run that model and how to obtain precisely the Figure in the paper.  (Should this fail fro the user, please let us know (hvwesterhoff@gmail.com)).  This is a feature we ourselves recommend for any modelling paper, as all too often there is no such correspondence between model files and publsihed results.
